# Job Application Tracker

A full-stack job application tracking app build with **Next.js App Router** and **MongoDB**, designed to demonstrate clean architecture, RESTful APIs, and thoughtful UX for real-world CRUD workflows.

> This project focuses on **clarity, correctness, and user experience**, rather than feature bloat.

---

## ✨ Features
- Public read-only application list
- Admin-only CRUD opeations
- Stateless REST API with proper HTTP semantics
- Accessible destructive actions
  - Keyboard support (ESC key)
  - Focus trapping and focus restoration
- Skeleton loading & empty states
- Clean separation between:
  - Server components (data fetching)
  - Client components (interactivity)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: --

## 🧱 Architecture Overview
App Router Structure
- Server components are used for **data fetching and routing**
- Client components handle **state, hooks, and user interaction**

Example:
- [`applications/page.jsx`](./src/app/applications/page.jsx)
  → server component (fetches data)
- [`ApplicationsClient.jsx`](./src/app/components/ApplicationsClient.jsx)
  → client wrapper (filters, admin logic)
- [`ApplicationsTable.jsx`](./src/app/components/ApplicationsTable.jsx)
  → presentational component

---

## 🔐 Admin vs Public Access
- The [`/applications`](./src/app/applications/) page is **public and read-only**
- Admin-only UI (create, edit, delete) is conditionally enabled
- Admin detection is handled **client-side** using a secret stored in `localStorage`
- UI gating is hydration-safe using a `mounted` check

This approach keeps the backend **stateless** while still allowing admin functionality for a personal project.

---

## 🔌 API Design
All data operations are handled through RESTful API routes under:
[`/api/applications`](./src/app/api/applications)

Supported operations:
- `GET` — fetch all applications
- `POST` — create a new application
- `PUT` — update an application
- `DELETE` — delete an application

The API uses:
- Consistent request/response shapes
- Proper ObjectId serialization
- Idempotent behavior where applicable

---

## ♿ UX & Accessibility Highlights
- Custom delete confirmation modal
- Keyboard navigation
  - Escape to close
  - Focus trapped inside modal
  - Focus restored to triggering element
- Explicit loading state for destructive actions
- Skeleton loaders prevent layout shifts

These choices were made intentionally to reflect **production-grade UX thinking**.

---

## 📂 Data Model
Each application follows a fixed schema:
- `companyName`
- `jobTitle`
- `workArrangement`
- `applicationStatus`
- `applicationDate`
- `notes`

Schema consistency is enforced across API and UI.

---

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd job-tracker
npm install
npm run dev
```
Create a `.env.local` file:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

---

## 📌 Project Scope & Trade-offs
This project intentionally:
- Does not include full authentication (JWT/session)
- Uses admin gating instead of multi-user auth
- Focuses on architecture, UX, and correctness

These trade-offs were made to prioritize **code clarity and maintainability** within limited scope.
